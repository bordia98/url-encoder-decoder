## 🌟 Guiding Principles

1. **100% Client-Side & Private**: All computation must run strictly inside the user's browser. Never introduce remote endpoints, tracking scripts, third-party analytics, or external data transmission.
2. **Zero Dependencies**: Keep the application lightweight, fast, and static. Use modern vanilla HTML5, CSS3, and ES6+ JavaScript.
3. **Accessibility & Polish**: Ensure smooth UX, keyboard navigability, responsive layouts across devices, and clean visual themes (light by default with dark mode support).
